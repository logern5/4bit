# Truth machine: If the user inputs 1, print 1 infinitely. If the user inputs 0, print 0 and exit.
# To compile the 4b file into a bin:
# $ cat truthmachine.4b | xxd -r -p > truthmachine.bin
# To run:
# $ python3 4bit.py truthmachine.bin
0: 1 # Push byte to stack
1: 30 # Byte to compare to (0x31 = '1')
3: 1 # Push byte to stack
4: 0f # Byte addr to jump to (to print '0')
6: d # Pop addr off A-stack and push on to B-stack
7: 9 # read byte from stdin
8: 5 # Jump to print '0' if read byte equals '0'
# Code for printing '1' infinitely starts here
9: 1 # Push byte to stack
a: 0d # Byte addr to jump to (loop to print '1')
c: d # Pop addr off A-stack and push onto B-stack
d: a # Print byte from stack ('1')
e: 8 # Unconditional jump to print byte again
# Code for printing '0' starts here
f: a # Print byte from stack ('0')
